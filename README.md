Things I learned and practiced in this project:

More useState practice.
Introduced to useRef and practiced useRef.
Refactored more code to adhere to the DRY principle.
Expanded my knowledge on useContext as it was used expansively in this project.
Got more practice mapping over static data in an object.
Introduced to the aside html tag for the first time and understood why it is used in Modals and Sidebars for example.
Got more practice using conditional rendering inside className attributes.
